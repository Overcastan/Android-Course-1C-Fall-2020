    <string name="content">The PL-15 is a 9mm short recoil-operated, locked-breech handgun that uses
        a modified Browning cam-lock system adapted from the Hi-Power pistol. The firearm"'"s locking
        mechanism uses a linkless, vertically tilting barrel with a rectangular breech that locks
        into the ejection port cut-out in the slide. It features a double-action only (DAO) trigger,
        requiring a long and heavy trigger pull that puts the hammer into a cocked state and then
        releases it with every shot. The trigger pull weight is 4 kg, and the full length of the
        trigger pull is 7 mm. It has a manual safety that, when engaged, disconnects the trigger
        from the hammer. All controls (manual safeties, slide release levers and magazine release
        buttons) are fully ambidextrous. A loaded chamber indicator is provided in the form of a pin
        that protrudes from the back of the slide when a round is present in the chamber.
        The PL-15-01 and PL-15K-01 variants of the pistol are striker-fired and have a single-action
        trigger with a significantly reduced trigger pull weight and length. Cartridges are fed from
        proprietary detachable double-stack single-feed magazines. It features removable front and
        rear dovetail sight posts, completely interchangeable with sights designed for Glock
        pistols. The frame features a picatinny rail underneath the barrel for the attachment of
        accessories. The PL-15 pistol can be equipped with an extended, threaded barrel for
        installing a silencer. </string>
